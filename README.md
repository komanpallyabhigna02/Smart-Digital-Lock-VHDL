# Smart Digital Lock Using VHDL

## Objective
To design a 4-bit password-based digital lock using VHDL and simulate it in Xilinx ISE.

## Tools Used
- Xilinx ISE
- VHDL
- ISim Simulator

## Project Description
This project implements a 4-bit password-based digital lock.
Correct password: 1011

If the password is correct:
- Unlock signal becomes HIGH.

If wrong password is entered 3 times:
- System enters LOCKED state.

## Simulation Results
(Insert screenshot below)

## Conclusion
The digital lock was successfully implemented and verified using behavioral simulation.
